WiP. Disclaimer. This is a for fun project.

### tryndusi objectives

Tryndusi aims to provide...

<ul>
  <li>a framework to describe / execute and enhance industry 4.0 use cases
  <li>an initial built-in implementation, easily upgradeable
  <li>an standalone / cluster or container based deployment
</ul>

Expect the initial solution to offer the following features...

<ul>
  <li>Discovery through a (clustered) registered
  <li>Scheduling using some meta-heuristics (annealing / genetic / gradient / ant colony...)
  <li>Descriptors (constraints, etc.) through YAML
  <li>Some rudimentary dashboard
  <li>SVG rendering
  <li>Push command / Pull variable / Subscribe event messaging
  <li>Push events through REST to external listeners
  <li>Custom pluggings which might be (optional) dynamically modifiable
</ul>

### Other remarks

Initially written in Java8+, might be migrated to other languages that integrate better with the cloud.
<p>
Migrating to Quarkus some components is also an option.
